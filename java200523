Java Data Types
As the name suggests, data types specify the type of data that can be stored inside variables in java.

Java is a statically-typed language. This means that all variables must be declared before they can be used.

8 Primitive Data Types
1. boolean type
The boolean data type has two possible values, either true or false.
Default value: false.
They are usually used for true/false conditions.
2. byte type
The byte data type can have values from -128 to 127 (8-bit signed two's complement integer).
If it's certain that the value of a variable will be within -128 to 127, then it is used instead of int to save memory.
Default value: 0
3. short type
The short data type in Java can have values from -32768 to 32767 (16-bit signed two's complement integer).
If it's certain that the value of a variable will be within -32768 and 32767
4. int type
The int data type can have values from -231 to 231-1 (32-bit signed two's complement integer).
If you are using Java 8 or later, you can use an unsigned 32-bit integer. This will have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232
5. long type
The long data type can have values from -263 to 263-1 .
If you are using Java 8 or later, you can use an unsigned 64-bit integer with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1.
Default value: 0
6. double type
The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit floating-point.
It should never be used for precise values such as currency.
Default value: 0.0 (0.0d)
7. float type
The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit floating-point.
It should never be used for precise values such as currency.
Default value: 0.0 (0.0f)
8. char type
It's a 16-bit Unicode character.
The minimum value of the char data type is '\u0000' (0) and the maximum value of the is '\uffff'.
Default value: '\u0000'
Java Strings
A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes.

example: String name="myname";

class Honda
{
static int dealer_id = 1234;  
static String owner_name = "Kumar";
int price; 
int cc; 
float discount;
public static void main (String args[])
{
Honda shine     =  new Honda(); //new allocates memory
Honda activa    =  new Honda(); 
Honda unicorn   =  new Honda();

shine.price=65000;
activa.price=80000;
unicorn.price=125000;
shine.discount=5.0f;
activa.discount=10.0f;
unicorn.discount=12.0f;
System.out.println(shine.price);
System.out.println(shine.discount);
System.out.println(activa.price);
System.out.println(activa.discount);
System.out.println(unicorn.price);
System.out.println(unicorn.discount);
System.out.println(owner_name);
System.out.println(dealer_id);
}
}
output:
java Honda
65000
5.0
80000
10.0
125000
12.0
Kumar
1234
